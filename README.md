# BangularMobile

## Background
This is a continuation of the project started here : https://github.com/Karma-Khameleons/bangazon-website. In the first iteration of this project, we created a basic UI for simulating an e-commerce platform a la Amazon. That was done completely in Python, utilizing the Django framework. In this version of the project, we are simulating the first steps to creating a mobile application that will have an AngularJS front end. The API we are using can be found here: https://github.com/Karma-Khameleons/bangazon_api. 

## Instructions 
Coming soon!
